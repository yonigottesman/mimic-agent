**Table source:** Hospital database.

**Table purpose:** Provides information when a patient was READY for discharge from the ICU, and when the patient was actually discharged from the ICU.

**Number of rows:** 34499

**Links to:**

* PATIENTS on `SUBJECT_ID`
* ADMISSIONS on `HADM_ID`

# Brief summary

The CALLOUT table provides information about ICU discharge planning. When a patient is deemed ready to leave the ICU, they are "called out". This process involves: (i) a care provider registering that the patient is ready to leave the ICU and detailing any specialized precautions required, (ii) a coordinator acknowledging the patient requires a bed outside the ward, (iii) a variable period of time in order to coordinate the transfer, and finally (iv) an outcome: either the patient is called out (discharged) or the call out event is canceled. This table provides information for all of the above.

# Important considerations

* Call out data is *not* available for all adult patients, as the data collection only began part way through the collection of the MIMIC database
* Call out data is *never* available for neonates

# Detailed description

The CALLOUT table provides information for "call out events". A call out event occurs as follows: first, a patient is ready for discharge from the ICU. A care provider creates a call out request (occurring at `CREATETIME`) stating the desired ward and any necessary precautions. The call out request is acknowledged, usually within a short period of time (`ACKNOWLEDGETIME`). When the patient is actually transferred out of the ICU, the `CALLOUT_OUTCOME` becomes 'Discharged' and the `OUTCOMETIME` column contains the time at which the patient was discharged.

## `SUBJECT_ID`, `HADM_ID`

`SUBJECT_ID` and `HADM_ID` define the patient and hospital admission corresponding to the given call out event.
? Unique

## `SUBMIT_WARDID`, `SUBMIT_CAREUNIT`

`SUBMIT_WARDID` identifies the ward from which the request was submitted. `SUBMIT_CAREUNIT` indicates whether the `SUBMIT_WARDID` corresponds to an ICU cost center, and if so, what type of ICU cost center.

## `CURR_WARDID`, `CURR_CAREUNIT`

`CURR_WARDID` identifies the ward in which the patient resides when called out (i.e. prior to discharge/transfer). `CURR_CAREUNIT` indicates which ICU cost center the `CURR_WARDID` corresponds to (note: since all patients are being discharged from an ICU, all patients should reside in an ICU cost center).

## `CALLOUT_WARDID`, `CALLOUT_SERVICE`

`CALLOUT_WARDID` identifies the ward to which the patient should be discharged. Note that `CALLOUT_WARDID` = 0 represents 'Home' and `CALLOUT_WARDID` = 1 represents 'First available ward'. The remaining IDs correspond to distinct wards in the hospital. `CALLOUT_SERVICE` is the service under which the patient should be discharged.


## `REQUEST_TELE`, `REQUEST_RESP`, `REQUEST_CDIFF`, `REQUEST_MRSA`, `REQUEST_VRE`

The request columns are binary indicators which request certain precautions for the patient in the subsequent ward where they will reside. For example, MRSA means that the patient is colonized or infected with MRSA, a drug resistant source of hospital acquired infections.

## `CALLOUT_STATUS`, `CALLOUT_OUTCOME`

`CALLOUT_STATUS` indicates whether the call out is still active or not: if a call out is answered it should be flagged as inactive. `CALLOUT_OUTCOME` is either 'Discharged' or 'Cancelled', indicating whether the patient finally called out (i.e. discharged) or not.

## `DISCHARGE_WARDID`

`DISCHARGE_WARDID` indicates the ward to which the patient was actually discharged. `DISCHARGE_WARDID` = 0 indicates home and other values correspond to distinct wards in the hospital.

## `ACKNOWLEDGE_STATUS`

`ACKNOWLEDGE_STATUS` indicates the response to the callout event: 'Acknowledged', 'Revised', 'Unacknowledged' or 'Reactivated'.

## `CREATETIME`, `UPDATETIME`, `ACKNOWLEDGETIME`, `OUTCOMETIME`, `FIRSTRESERVATIONTIME`, `CURRENTRESERVATIONTIME`

`CREATETIME` provides the time and date that the call out was initiated. `UPDATETIME` provides the last time at which the call out event was updated. `ACKNOWLEDGETIME` is the time at which the call out was first acknowledged.
`OUTCOMETIME` is the time at which the `CALLOUT_OUTCOME` occurred. `FIRSTRESERVATIONTIME` and `CURRENTRESERVATIONTIME` provide information regarding ward reservations.
