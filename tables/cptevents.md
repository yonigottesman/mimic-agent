**Table source:** Hospital database.

**Table purpose:** Contains current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, which facilitate billing for procedures performed on patients.

**Number of rows:** 573146

**Links to:**

* PATIENTS on `SUBJECT_ID`
* ADMISSIONS on `HADM_ID`

# Brief summary

The CPTEVENTS table contains a list of which current procedural terminology codes were billed for which patients. This can be useful for determining if certain procedures have been performed (e.g. ventilation).

# Important considerations

* The respiratory cost center bills for ventilation *regardless* of duration. That means that 30 minutes of mechanical ventilation for a single day would result in same billing code as a full 24 hours of mechanical ventilation.
* Non-invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation use the same CPT code. Differentiating these concepts requires selecting them using the `DESCRIPTION` column.

# Detailed Description

`CPTEVENTS` contains current procedural terminology (CPT) codes for patients as billed through either the ICU cost center or the respiratory cost center. Each code represents a distinct procedure performed on the patient during their ICU stay.

## `SUBJECT_ID`, `HADM_ID`

Identifiers which specify the patient: `SUBJECT_ID` is unique to a patient and `HADM_ID` is unique to a patient hospital stay.

## `COSTCENTER`

`COSTCENTER` is the cost center which billed for the corresponding CPT codes. There are two possible cost centers: 'ICU' and 'Resp'. 'Resp' codes correspond to mechanical or non-invasive ventilation and were billed by the respiratory therapist. 'ICU' codes correspond to the procedures billed for by the ICU.

## `CHARTDATE`

The date at which the procedure occurred.

## `CPT_CD`, `CPT_NUMBER`, `CPT_SUFFIX`

`CPT_CD` contains the original CPT code. `CPT_NUMBER` is a numeric version of the `CPT_CD` column, which allows for easier range comparisons in querying. However, note not all `CPT_CD` are fully numeric. The `CPT_SUFFIX` column contains the text suffix when the `CPT_CD` contains non-numeric characters.

## `TICKET_ID_SEQ`

The order of the `CPT_CD`.

## `SECTIONHEADER`, `SUBSECTIONHEADER`

The section headers provide a category for the given CPT code. These headers were assigned using the D_CPT table.

## `DESCRIPTION`

In the case of a `CPT_CD` corresponding to the respiratory cost center, the description provides information about the meaning of the CPT code. Otherwise, the field is null.
