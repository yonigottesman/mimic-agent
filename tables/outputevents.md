# Detailed Description

## SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ICUSTAY_ID

Identifiers which specify the patient: `SUBJECT_ID` is unique to a patient, `HADM_ID` is unique to a patient hospital stay and `ICUSTAY_ID` is unique to a patient ICU stay.

## CHARTTIME

`CHARTTIME` is the time of an output event.

## ITEMID

Identifier for a single measurement type in the database. Each row associated with one `ITEMID` (e.g. 212) corresponds to an instantiation of the same measurement (e.g. heart rate).

Metavision `ITEMID` values are all above 220000. A subset of commonly used medications in CareVue data have `ITEMID` values are between 30000-39999. The remaining input/output `ITEMID` values are between 40000-49999.

## VALUE, VALUEUOM

`VALUE` and `VALUEUOM` list the amount of a substance at the `CHARTTIME` (when the exact start time is unknown, but usually up to an hour before).

## STORETIME

`STORETIME` records the time at which an observation was manually input or manually validated by a member of the clinical staff.

## CGID

`CGID` is the identifier for the caregiver who validated the given measurement.

## STOPPED, NEWBOTTLE, ISERROR

`STOPPED` indicates if the order was disconnected at the given `CHARTTIME`. `NEWBOTTLE` indicates that a new bag of solution was hung at the given `CHARTTIME`. `ISERROR` is a Metavision checkbox where a care giver can specify that an observation is an error. No other details are provided.
