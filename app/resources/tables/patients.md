**Table source:** CareVue and Metavision ICU databases.

**Table purpose:** Defines each SUBJECT\_ID in the database, i.e. defines a single patient.

**Number of rows:** 46,520

**Links to:**

* ADMISSIONS on `SUBJECT_ID`
* ICUSTAYS on `SUBJECT_ID`

# Important considerations

* `DOB` has been shifted for patients older than 89. The median age for the patients whose date of birth was shifted is 91.4.

# Detailed Description

## `SUBJECT_ID`

`SUBJECT_ID` is a unique identifier which specifies an individual patient. `SUBJECT_ID` is a candidate key for the table, so is unique for each row. Information that is consistent for the lifetime of a patient is stored in this table.

## `GENDER`

`GENDER` is the genotypical sex of the patient.

## `DOB`

`DOB` is the date of birth of the given patient. Patients who are older than 89 years old at any time in the database have had their date of birth shifted to obscure their age and comply with HIPAA. The shift process was as follows: the patient's age at their first admission was determined. The date of birth was then set to exactly 300 years before their first admission. <!-- As a result, all patients-->

## `DOD`, `DOD_HOSP`, `DOD_SSN`

`DOD` is the date of death for the given patient. `DOD_HOSP` is the date of death as recorded in the hospital database. `DOD_SSN` is the date of death from the social security database. Note that `DOD` merged together `DOD_HOSP` and `DOD_SSN`, giving priority to `DOD_HOSP` if both were recorded.

## `EXPIRE_FLAG`

`EXPIRE_FLAG` is a binary flag which indicates whether the patient died, i.e. whether `DOD` is null or not. These deaths include both deaths within the hospital (`DOD_HOSP`) and deaths identified by matching the patient to the social security master death index (`DOD_SSN`).
